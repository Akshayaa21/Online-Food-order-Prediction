# Online-Food-orders-Prediction Model: Identifying Customer Retention

Introduction:

The advent of food delivery services has transformed the way people consume food. As the competition in the food delivery industry increases, there is a growing need for companies to find ways to retain customers. One of the key objectives of food delivery businesses is to understand customer behavior patterns and predict if a customer is likely to re-order food


Online-Food-order-Prediction:
        
The food industry is a complex domain with diverse customer choices, which makes predicting re-orders a challenging task. In this project, we apply machine learning algorithms to build a model that predicts if a customer is likely to re-order food. We will use a Random Forest algorithm to create a model that can accurately predict re-orders and identify the key factors that influence customer behavior.


Model Creation:
        
Our model is based on Random forests, a popular technique in machine learning that creates an ensemble of decision trees and combines their outputs to provide a final prediction. We will use customer attributes such as age, gender, Occupation, Monthly Income and past orders as inputs to the model. The output of the model will be a score that indicates the likelihood of the customer re-ordering food
        

Model Evaluation:

To evaluate the performance of the model, we will split the data into training and testing sets. We found out that 54% of the customers don't fall into any income group so they could be housewife or students. With this Model we can also input data we want to get results about individual customers too . But as for our data there is 98 percent accuracy that the customers will order again.
